        good idea to wait until you've decided on your new puppy before going
        shopping for supplies. Some items, such as food and water bowls or
        collars and leashes, are dependent on the size of the dog you are
        adopting. Also, find out what food your dog was eating in the shelter or
        foster home so you may feed it in the beginning to aid the adjustment.
        After the dog has settled in, consult with your veterinarian about
        switching to your preferred diet. Canis familiaris or Canis lupus
        familiaris is a domesticated wolf descendent. The domestic dog is
        descended from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the present wolf is the
        dog's closest surviving relative. The dog was the first creature to be
        domesticated by hunter-gatherers approximately 15,000 years ago, before
        agriculture was developed. Dogs have expanded to a vast number of
        domestic individuals as a result of their long contact with people, and
        they have developed the ability to subsist on a starch-rich diet that
        would be insufficient for other canids. Cool stuff!!
