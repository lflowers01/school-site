      <h1>Spanish Research Paper ~ Manolete The Bullfighter</h1>
      <p class="english">
        Manolete was a famous Spanish bullfighter born in Spain. He was one of
        the top matadors of the 1940s, famous for being clumsy- but brave. He
        made his famous debut when he was only 17 when he killed a bull of the
        dreaded Miura breed. For almost a decade Manolete was considered a
        Spanish folk hero. He was so popular that he earned 4 million euro in
        just 8 years of bullfighting. One year - it is said he performed upwards
        of 100 times in a single year. He was injured only 11 times in his 8
        years of bullfighting. When he announced his retirement, he was
        challenged by Domingu√≠n, his young rival, to a battle in bull fighting.
        That day he was fatally injured, he took a bull horn to the stomach. His
        death was mourned by many, and his life remembered by many more.
