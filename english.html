        The first known record of mac and cheese appears in the medieval Italian
        cookbook known as Liber de Coquina, its title translates to “The Book Of
        Cooking”. This book, published in the early 14th century, pioneered some
        of the earliest written recipes of its time, covering food categories
        such as fish, poultry, and pastries, even going over recipes of fine
        wine. The book describes mac and cheese as a type of lasagna, using
        longer flatter noodles instead of the curved noodles we know today. This
        recipe became popular as more people learned to read with the rise of
        the printing press, and more people had access to the ingredients
        required as well. German cooks later created the curved noodles we are
        familiar with. This noodle design quickly spread throughout Europe and
        became the new standard for mac and cheese. At the time of the early
        American pioneers, crops such as wheat and grain were not uncommon in
        the new land, so noodles were created very often to feed the early
        villages of the time. Dairy livestock was also in abundance, so these
        two common food products were combined to make macaroni and cheese.
        Early in the civil war and at the beginning of the industrial
        revolution, America’s first factories were being created, and food
        products like cheese, milk and processed meats were becoming more
        prominent in American grocery stores. The first world war in America
        only increased the demand for processed food, thus creating Kraft Mac
        and Cheese, one of the biggest, most known food brands today. Kraft was
        the original creator of powdered cheese, first being created to feed
        soldiers during the war. As time went on more people began to enjoy this
        quick and easy meal. The convenience and inexpensive qualities of the
        product only helped its growth and profit spread across America.

      <p>
        Macaroni and cheese is the dinner everyone wishes they had. The white
        casserole dish, the bottom filled with 2% milk, and a variety of
        cheeses, comes together in a huge cheesy extravaganza. Fresh butter sits
        on top of the many layers of yellow-orange purity. Homemade, savoury
        smell fresh from the oven. Sprinkled bread crumbs caked on top of the
        encrusted cheese. Slowly cracking open, as the shell of baked cheeses
        and butter is cooped the macaroni into the ceramic bowl. Savoury flavour
        spreads onto your taste buds. Chewing the crusted cheddar cheese.
        Feeling it on your tongue. Sipping homemade tart lemonade as you consume
        this glorious meal. With a side of steamed bratwurst, with homemade
        german mustard. Spicey savoury hot sausage. Pliant cheesy noodles,
        melting on the tongue with the slightest contact. Afterwards, homemade
        ice cream with grandma’s fresh chocolate fudge. Hot brown sauce slowly
        melts the icy creamy mixture.

        All starch noodles have some kind of unique shape. Farfalle is shaped
        like a tie, Konkiloni presented itself as a sea shell, and Cavatappi was
        twisted and turned left and right. But, macaroni could be seen as the
        runt of the group, as it only existed with one, small bend. He regularly
        felt ashamed of himself, thinking that he needs to be more to make up
        for his simple looks. He lay on his shelf at night feeling like a part
        of himself was missing. But one day it all changed. July 14th, 2008, he
        met someone who would change his life, who would make him feel
        comfortable in his own noodley body. He was sitting on his shelf one day
        when he saw someone across the room sitting by the base of the Samsung
        Smart Fridge 2022 edition. A small piece of shredded cheese was sitting
        all alone feeling like it needed someone too. He felt longing toward
        this piece of cheese as if it was the last piece to his puzzle. He
        needed to reach it, but it was so far away, yet so close. The only thing
        that was in between him and his destiny was the dirty, filthy ground of
        the pantry. Once he mustered up the courage to take the leap, he
        valiantly jumped from his third shelf up and landed on the mucky floor.
        He started to rock back and forth to build up the momentum he needed to
        roll over to where his destiny lay. With all the courage he could
        muster, he slowly approached the small piece of cheese. Once he made it
        to the cheese, they somehow created mac and cheese and all was well with
        the world.

        Mac and cheese is so good and yummy. I would eat it every day if I could. Thank you mac and cheese for making me happy.
